How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It clearly indicated what lines were changed which allowed me to view those lines only
    
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Having the history on hand allows me to find mistakes quickly and revert to previous versions
	in necessary

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Con, you may forget to save it it's not done automatically
	Pro, you can choose where you save, save often, and frequently. It is also more flexible

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git is used for coding, which requires changing multiple files at one time. Google Docs
	is more for word processing and excel sheets which work with one file at a time
    To be more precise, sometimes, when coding a change, it must be done across several files 
    to work.
